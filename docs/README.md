# Zig Rig - A Planning Tool for Power Distribution

## Description

Zig-Rig is a simple, easy-to-use online planning tool for calculating electrical power distribution for a multitude of power sources. When planning projects involving heavy use of electrical power, it is important to not overload the generators or to throw them off balance. Tools exist for this use already (e.g. AutoDISE, AutoCAD, etc.), but they are designed for expert-level professionals and are cumbersome to use and set up. This application is designed with the layman in mind. Some uses include planning for:

* Concerts
* Film Shoots
* Fund-raisers
* Military (At the lower-level)

Calculations get especially complicated when using 3-phase and dual-voltage generators. ZigRig will automatically calculate kVA to kW conversions and individual coil loads to better visualize where to wire your equipment. You will be able to save your wiring setups to your account and print them out to bring to the field for reference.
